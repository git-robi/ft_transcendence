### Create and populate the environment variables files

The values of the variables must be shared privately so you'll have to ask me for them. We can use the service share.doppler.com to share env values securely.

1. In the root folder, create a .env and a .env.development ile and put in it all the variables that you find in ./.env.example. 
2. Move into nginx/ folder, delete the ssl folder if already existing and run ./generate-ssh.sh
3. Back to root folder, run ./scripts/setup-secrets.sh to create secret files. 5 empty secret files are created
4. Now populate those files: 
    - for github and google files, do 'echo "the_secret_key" > secrets/google_xxxx' for each file
    - for passwords and token files, 'openssl rand -hex 32 > secrets/the_file_to_feed'for each file

### And that's it!
That's it basically, you can start working accessing the website through the browser while everything will run on containers in detached mode so you will be able to use the terminal :D
